## Using the website
Right now, to test the website, login as either *gqo* or *amvasquez*. They are a matched pair. *gqo* is learning Spanish while *amvasquez* is learning English.

From the main page, you can click on Login in the top right corner and type in one of those usernames. Please click the "Log In" button. Do not press enter.

Once you are logged in, you can cick on Chats in the top left corner and you will see a list of the users you are matched with. If you're logged in as *gqo*, the only person in this list will be *amvasquez* (and vice versa).

Click on one of the users in that list to begin chatting. You will now be able to see the chat history on the left and the current lesson on the right. It is not live so make sure to refresh often if you're having a lively discussion.

When you and your partner are ready to move on to the next lesson, both of you must click the "Request to continue" button in the bottom right. Again, you should refresh to make sure you've moved on correctly.
